# usbasp-buttons
Buttons and blinkenlights on a usbasp

Put the seven available GPIO's on the usbasp to use for pushbuttons and LED's via usb and libusb.

Basically the usbasp is turned into a self-flashable [digispark](http://digistump.com/products/1) type device, flashable via [micronucleus](https://github.com/micronucleus/micronucleus)
